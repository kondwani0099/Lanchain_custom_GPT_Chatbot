# Lanchain Custom GPT Chatbot

This project utilizes Lanchain to develop a custom data chatbot leveraging OpenAI's GPT models.

## How It Works

To get started:

1. Download the project files.
2. Use Google Colab to execute the provided code.
3. Ensure the document you want to utilize for data retrieval is stored in the "storage" folder within Google Colab.

### Data Retrieval

The chatbot retrieves information from a document containing data about Zambian companies. It utilizes Lanchain to facilitate data retrieval.
